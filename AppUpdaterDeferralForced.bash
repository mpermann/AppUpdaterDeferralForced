# The script is for patching an app with user notification before starting and supports deferrals with
# tracking. Parameter 4 is the name of the app to be patched, parameter 5 is the name of the app process, 
# parameter 6 is the policy trigger name to install the app, parameter 7 is the number of deferrals and
# parameter 8 is the countdown timer in seconds. The script is relatively basic and can't currently kill 
# more than one process or patch more than one app.

DESCRIPTION="Greetings Heartland Area Education Agency Staff

An update for $APP_NAME is available.  Please return to $APP_NAME and save your work and quit the application BEFORE returning here and clicking the \"OK\" button to proceed with the update. Caution: your work could be lost if you don't save it and quit $APP_NAME before clicking the \"OK\" button.

You may click the \"Cancel\" button to defer this update. You can defer a maximum of $MAX_DEFERRAL times. You have deferred ${CURRENT_DEFERRAL_COUNT} times.

Thanks! - IT Department"
